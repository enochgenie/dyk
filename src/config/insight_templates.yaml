  # === HIGH-IMPACT QUANTIFIED ACTIONS ===
  # Pattern: "Action X for Y time → Z% improvement in outcome"
  
  quantified_action_benefit:
    type: "quantified_action_benefit"
    description: "Specific action with precise time/frequency that produces measurable outcome"
    weight: 15  # HIGHEST - This is the most common pattern in ideal examples
    structure: |
      [Action] for [duration/frequency] [produces dramatic result with %].
      [Brief mechanism why]. [Immediate specific action to start today].
    example:
      - "150 minutes moderate activity weekly reduces chronic disease by 30%—that's only 21 minutes daily. Start with a brisk walk during lunch break today."
      - "Sleeping 7-8 hours nightly has lowest mortality risk. This sweet spot optimizes immune function, metabolism, cellular repair. Prioritize consistent 7-8 hour sleep windows."
      - "Eating 1 handful (30g) nuts daily reduces heart disease by 30%, stroke by 20%, all-cause mortality by 22%. Include almonds, walnuts, pistachios daily."
    tone: "Direct, evidence-driven, immediately actionable"
    
  comparative_effectiveness:
    type: "comparative_effectiveness"
    description: "Compare two approaches showing one is surprisingly more/equally effective"
    weight: 8
    structure: |
      [Surprising comparison with specific numbers showing efficiency].
      [Why the less obvious approach works]. [Action to implement the better approach].
    example:
      - "Just 75 minutes weekly vigorous exercise equals heart benefits of 150 min moderate. This HPB-recommended minimum dose cuts cardiovascular mortality by 20-30%. Do 25-min HIIT 3x/week."
      - "10-minute walk after each meal lowers blood sugar 12% more than one 30-minute daily walk. Post-meal activity uses glucose as muscles contract. Walk 10 minutes after dinner tonight."
      - "Protein-rich breakfast improves concentration by 25%, reduces cravings by 60% vs. sugary cereals. Protein stabilizes blood sugar. Start with eggs, Greek yogurt, or tofu."

    description: "Present significant risk THEN show how to reverse/mitigate it dramatically"
    weight: 12
    structure: |
      [Behavior/condition] increases [serious outcome] by [shocking %].
      [Mechanism of harm]. [Specific action that reverses/prevents it with % improvement].
    example:
      - "Sleeping less than 7 hours increases anxiety risk by 2.5x. Your brain needs deep sleep to consolidate memories and regulate emotions. Aim to be in bed by 11pm tonight."
      - "Sitting 8+ hours daily increases metabolic syndrome risk by 90%, independent of exercise. Prolonged sitting impairs glucose metabolism. Stand/walk 2 minutes every 30 minutes."
      - "Young men who binge drink (5+ drinks) are 70% more likely to develop hypertension by age 35. That Friday night out could mean lifelong medication. Try alternating drinks with water."

      [Action that leverages this mechanism].
    example:
      - "Sleeping less than 6 hours increases obesity risk by 41% by dysregulating hunger hormones—ghrelin rises 15%, leptin drops 15%. Sleep deprivation makes you hungrier and less satisfied. Prioritize 7-8 hours."
      - "Exercise is as effective as antidepressants for mild depression, reducing symptoms 40-50%. Physical activity boosts endorphins and serotonin naturally. Schedule 30 min movement 5 days weekly."

      - "Fast eating (under 10 min) doubles obesity risk—satiety signals take 20 minutes to register. You consume 15% more before feeling full. Put utensils down between bites, take minimum 20 minutes."
      - "2+ hours daily social media comparing yourself to others increases depression by 70%. Social comparison damages self-esteem. Unfollow triggering accounts, limit scrolling to 30 min daily."

      - "Walking 7,000 steps daily reduces mortality by 50-70% vs. 4,000 steps. You don't need 10,000—7,000 provides maximum benefit. Track steps, aim for 7,000-8,000 daily."
      - "Just 20g dark chocolate (70%+ cocoa) daily lowers blood pressure 2-3 mmHg, improves blood flow 20%. Flavanols act as natural vasodilators. Enjoy 15-20g as afternoon treat."

  synergistic_multiplier:
    type: "synergistic_multiplier"
    description: "Show how combining interventions creates exponential, not additive, benefits"
    weight: 6
    structure: |
      [Action 1] + [Action 2] produces [X-fold better outcome] than either alone.
      [Why the combination is synergistic]. [How to implement both simultaneously].

      - "Laughing 10 minutes reduces stress hormones by 30%, boosts immune cells by 25%. Laughter triggers endorphins, relaxes muscles for 45 minutes. Watch comedy or call funny friend weekly."
      - "Brisk walkers live 15-20 years longer than slow walkers—regardless of body weight. Walking pace reveals cardiovascular fitness better than most tests. Aim for 100 steps/min (3 mph)."
