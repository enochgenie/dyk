priority_cohorts:

  # === METABOLIC HEALTH FOCUS ===
  
  - name: "office_workers_metabolic_risk"

      bmi: ["overweight", "obese"]
      physical_activity: ["sedentary"]
      occupation_context: ["desk_job"]
    priority: 1
    description: "Sedentary office workers at risk of metabolic diseases"
    rationale: "Singapore's 8.6% diabetes rate driven by sedentary work culture + weight. Sitting 8+ hrs daily compounds metabolic risk. High prevention potential through workplace interventions."
    insight_angles:
      - "Desk-based micro-movements (standing breaks, walking meetings)"
      - "Hawker center meal optimization for busy workers"
      - "Post-lunch walks to manage blood sugar spikes"
      - "Weekend activity catch-up strategies"


  - name: "shift_workers_metabolic_risk"
    dimensions:
      age_group: ["30-44", "45-59"]
      occupation_context: ["shift_work"]
      health_conditions: ["prediabetes", "hypertension"]
    priority: 1
    description: "Shift workers with disrupted circadian rhythms"
    rationale: "Night shift work increases metabolic syndrome by 36%, diabetes by 40%. Large Singapore workforce (healthcare, transport, F&B). Circadian disruption is modifiable."
    insight_angles:
      - "Eating windows optimization for night shifts"
      - "Sleep hygiene for shift workers"
      - "Light exposure management"
      - "Meal timing strategies"

  # === CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH FOCUS ===

      age_group: ["30-44", "45-59"]
      occupation_context: ["high_stress_job"]
      health_conditions: ["hypertension", "high-cholesterol"]
      lifestyle: ["insufficient_sleep"]
    priority: 1
    description: "High-stress professionals"
    rationale: "Work stress increases CVD by 23%. Singapore's long work hours (45+ hrs/week) + multiple CVD risks create perfect storm. Stress management is underutilized intervention."
    insight_angles:
      - "Stress-reduction techniques during workday"
      - "Sleep optimization for busy professionals"
      - "Mediterranean diet adaptations for local context"
      - "Efficient exercise for time-poor adults"

  - name: "ethnic_high_risk_cvd"
    dimensions:
      race: ["malay", "indian"]
      age_group: ["30-44", "45-59"]
      health_conditions: ["diabetes", "hypertension", "high-cholesterol"]
    priority: 1
    description: "Malay/Indian adults"
    rationale: "Indians develop CVD 10 years earlier with 3-4x higher risk. Cultural dietary patterns (ghee, coconut milk, refined carbs) are modifiable. Ethnicity-aware interventions needed."
    insight_angles:
      - "Traditional recipe modifications (reduce santan, swap oils)"
      - "Ethnic-specific genetic considerations"
      - "Culturally-appropriate exercise options"
      - "Family-based intervention strategies"

  # === WOMEN'S HEALTH FOCUS ===

    dimensions:
      age_group: ["45-59"]
      gender: ["female"]
      life_stage: ["perimenopause"]
    priority: 1
    description: "Women navigating perimenopausal transition"
    rationale: "Women lose 20% bone density post-menopause, CVD risk doubles. Critical prevention window. Asian women experience menopause 2 years earlier (avg age 48-49)."
    insight_angles:
      - "Bone density preservation strategies"
      - "Hot flash management (non-hormonal)"
      - "Weight management during hormonal shifts"
      - "Strength training for bone/muscle health"

  - name: "postpartum_weight_management"
    dimensions:
      age_group: ["18-29", "30-44"]
      gender: ["female"]
      life_stage: ["postpartum"]
    priority: 2
    description: "New mothers managing postpartum weight"
    rationale: "Postpartum weight retention increases long-term obesity risk. Singapore's high C-section rate (30%) and cultural confinement practices impact recovery. Targeted support can improve maternal health."
    insight_angles:
      - "Culturally-sensitive postpartum nutrition"
      - "Safe exercise routines post-C-section"
      - "Mental health support for new mothers"
      - "Time-efficient workouts for busy moms"

  - name: "student_mental_health"
    dimensions:
      age_group: ["18-29"]
      occupation_context: ["student"]
      health_conditions: ["stress", "anxiety", "poor_sleep"]
    priority: 2
    description: "Students under academic pressure"
    rationale: "1 in 7 students experience depression. Exam stress, social media comparison, sleep deprivation compound. Mental health intervention in youth prevents lifelong issues."
    insight_angles:
      - "Stress management during exam periods"
      - "Social media reduction strategies"
      - "Sleep hygiene for students"
      - "Exercise as antidepressant"

      health_concerns: ["fall_risk", "sarcopenia", "cognitive_decline"]
    priority: 1
    description: "Seniors at risk of functional decline"
    rationale: "1 in 3 seniors fall annually. Sarcopenia accelerates disability. Exercise reduces dementia by 35%. Singapore's aging population (19% over 65 by 2030) needs intervention."
    insight_angles:
      - "Fall prevention exercises (balance, strength)"
      - "Sarcopenia prevention (protein + resistance training)"
