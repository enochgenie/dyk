The insight accurately reflects the sleep duration increase, but 'sleep onset' is a simplification of 'sleep onset latency' and the 35% reduction is for latency, not necessarily a direct 'improvement' in onset time in the way a layperson might interpret it (e.g., falling asleep 35% faster than their baseline, which is true, but the phrasing could be slightly clearer). The 'serotonin and antioxidants that regulate sleep cycles' part is a plausible mechanism based on the study's discussion, but the study itself doesn't definitively prove this mechanism in humans, rather it hypothesizes it."

While reducing santan will reduce saturated fat, the exact 40% figure and the claim of 'preserving flavor' are highly dependent on the specific recipe, original amount of santan, and individual taste preferences. It's a plausible reduction but the specific percentage without context is hard to verify universally. The claim that 'Santan is rich in lauric acid which raises LDL cholesterol significantly, increasing cardiovascular risks for those with hypertension' is generally accurate, as lauric acid is a saturated fat known to raise LDL, and high LDL is a risk factor for CVD, especially for those with hypertension.
