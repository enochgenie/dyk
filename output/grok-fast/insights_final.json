While increased fiber intake is associated with reduced diabetes risk, the specific 10g increase leading to a 19% reduction is likely derived from a broader dietary pattern or a specific study's findings, and applying it directly to 'ordering hawker veggie sides' needs careful contextualization. The Lancet article cited is a meta-analysis on dietary fiber and whole grains, not specifically about hawker veggie sides or a 10g increase. The 19% reduction is plausible for a significant increase in fiber, but attributing it directly to '10g from hawker veggie sides' is a strong extrapolation.",
              "The source (The Lancet meta-analysis) is highly credible for general dietary fiber benefits, but the insight's specific quantification (10g fiber from hawker veggie sides = 19% reduction) is not directly supported by the abstract or easily derivable from the general findings without deeper analysis of the study's methodology and specific food sources. The study reports a 19% reduction in incidence of type 2 diabetes for the highest vs lowest intake of dietary fiber, and a 16% reduction for every 15g/day increase in total fiber. A 10g increase is significant, but the direct link to 19% needs to be carefully checked against the study's specific dose-response curves or subgroups."

It cites a 43% lower risk for 7,500 steps/day vs. 2,700 steps/day in one specific study (Paffenbarger et al., 1993) and a 50% lower risk for 8,000 steps/day vs. 4,000 steps/day in another (Lee et al., 2019, JAMA Internal Medicine).
